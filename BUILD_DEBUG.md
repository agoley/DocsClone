# Debugging Client Build Issues on Render

If you're seeing the message "API Server is running. Client app is not built yet." after deployment, it means the React client application wasn't built properly during the deployment process. Here are steps to debug and fix the issue:

## Step 1: Check the Build Logs

First, check the Render deployment logs for any errors during the build process:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Click on the "Logs" tab
4. Look for any errors in the build section

Common issues might include:

- Dependency installation failures
- React build errors
- Path problems

## Step 2: Manual Build Testing

To verify if the build process works locally:

```bash
# Clone your repository if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/agoley/DocsClone.git
cd DocsClone

# Check out your deployment branch
git checkout render-bootstrapping

# Test the build script
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

If this works locally but fails on Render, it could be due to:

- Environment differences
- Node.js version differences
- Memory limitations during build

## Step 3: Simplified Build Process

We've updated your render.yaml to use a more robust build script (build.sh) that:

- Provides better error reporting
- Adds the CI=false flag to prevent treating warnings as errors
- Has better error handling

If you continue to have issues, you can try an even simpler approach:

1. Build the client locally
2. Commit the built files to a "production" branch
3. Deploy that branch directly

## Step 4: Environment Variables

We've added `CI=false` to your environment variables to prevent the React build from failing due to warnings. If you're still having issues, you might want to check if there are specific environment variables needed for your build.

## Step 5: Check Resource Limitations

Render's free tier has memory limitations that might affect large builds. If your client application is large or complex, you might need to:

1. Simplify your application temporarily
2. Upgrade to a paid plan with more resources
3. Build locally and commit the built files

## Next Steps

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please:

1. Check if there are specific error messages in the Render logs
2. Try deploying a simplified version of your application
3. Consider building the client and server separately

Once your client successfully builds, you should see your full application instead of the "API Server is running" message.
